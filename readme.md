# SwingPlus

SwingPlus is a library of custom `Swing` components. It is a work in progress, and more
components will be added over time.

Notes:
- This library was created for `Java 21`. But has a jar for `Java 8`

## Components

### SPRoundPanel

`SPRoundPanel` is panel with rounded corners. It can be used as a container for other
components. The class extends from `JPanel`, so it has all the same methods and properties.

### SPGradientRoundPanel

`SPGradientRoundPanel` is a panel with rounded corners and a gradient background. It can be
used as a container for other components. The class extends from `SPRoundPanel`, so it has 
all the methods and properties of `SPRoundPanel` and `JPanel`.

### SPRoundMediaPanel

`SPRoundMediaPanel` is a panel with rounded corners and a media content. It can be used as a
container for other components. The class extends from `SPRoundPanel`, so it has all the
methods and properties of `SPRoundPanel` and `JPanel`. Multimedia content can only be images 
and gifs.

## Usage

The library can be used in any Java project. To use it, download the latest release and add
the jar file to your project's classpath. Then, import the classes you want to use in your
code.
